 It sounds like the bot is stuck in a loop and repeatedly responding to the same events. This usually happens when your webhook or event listener processes the same message multiple times without a proper deduplication check or self-check. Here’s a step-by-step approach to resolve the issue:

Add Deduplication Using Cast Hashes:
Keep track of which casts the bot has already processed. Every cast event comes with a unique hash. You can store this hash in a Set or Map in memory:

js
Copy code
const processedCasts = new Set();

async function handleWebhookEvent(cast) {
  // If we’ve seen this cast before, skip it
  if (processedCasts.has(cast.hash)) {
    console.log(`Duplicate event detected for cast: ${cast.hash}, ignoring.`);
    return;
  }

  // Mark this cast as processed
  processedCasts.add(cast.hash);

  // Optional cleanup after some time to prevent memory growth
  setTimeout(() => processedCasts.delete(cast.hash), 10 * 60 * 1000); // after 10 minutes

  // Process the cast here
  await processCast(cast);
}
Check for Self-Messages:
Make sure the bot isn’t responding to its own messages. If the cast’s author is the same as your bot’s author (e.g., mienfoo.eth), skip responding:

js
Copy code
if (cast.author.username === 'mienfoo.eth') {
  console.log(`Ignoring self-message from ${cast.author.username}`);
  return;
}
Verify You’re Only Responding When Mentioned by Others:
Make sure you’re filtering events so you only respond when another user mentions your bot. If your bot is reprocessing events where it mentioned someone else (like @collectorscanyon.eth), add a check that verifies the mention came from a different user, not from the bot itself.

Improve Logging:
Add more detailed logs before and after you process a cast:

js
Copy code
console.log('Received event:', JSON.stringify(cast, null, 2));
This will help you confirm whether multiple identical webhook events are arriving or if your logic is getting called repeatedly due to other conditions.

Check Webhook Configuration:
Sometimes, webhook endpoints can be called multiple times for the same event. Ensure that:

Your webhook setup is not retrying on success.
You’re returning the correct status code (e.g., 200) after successfully processing an event.
Throttle or Debounce:
If you still face issues, add a short throttle or debounce mechanism. For example, ignore events that arrive too closely together with the same hash or identical text, beyond the first one processed.

Summary:

Implement a Set to track processed cast hashes.
Ignore casts authored by your own bot.
Ensure you only respond when another user mentions you.
Add detailed logging to confirm the flow of events.
Validate your webhook setup so it’s not sending duplicates.
By combining these steps, you should be able to stop the bot from continually responding over and over. Once your deduplication and self-checks are rock-solid, you can safely integrate the Google Vision API and further enhance your bot’s responses.

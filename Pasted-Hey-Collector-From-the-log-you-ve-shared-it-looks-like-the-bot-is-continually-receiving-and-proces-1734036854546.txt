Hey Collector! From the log you’ve shared, it looks like the bot is continually receiving and processing the same webhook event multiple times. Notice that the same cast hash (0x31fbbf5b470e07f726d64bfaeedf33e557a3740d) is triggering a new reply at least three times. This strongly suggests that the webhook is being called repeatedly for the same event, not that the bot is initiating it on its own.

What’s happening?
The Neynar or Farcaster webhook endpoint might be sending the same cast.created event multiple times. This can occur if:

The server isn’t returning a proper 200 response, causing the webhook sender to retry.
There’s no deduplication logic in your code, so each identical event is treated as new.
How to Fix It:

Implement Deduplication by Cast Hash:
Use the cast’s unique hash to ensure you only respond once. Before processing, check if you’ve already handled that hash:

js
Copy code
const processedCasts = new Set();

async function handleWebhookEvent(event) {
  const castHash = event.data.object.hash;

  if (processedCasts.has(castHash)) {
    console.log(`Duplicate event detected for ${castHash}. Skipping.`);
    return;
  }

  processedCasts.add(castHash);
  // Optional: remove old entries after a delay to prevent memory leaks.
  setTimeout(() => processedCasts.delete(castHash), 10 * 60 * 1000);

  // Process the event and respond
}
Verify Successful Response to the Webhook Sender:
Make sure your webhook endpoint returns res.status(200).send() (or equivalent) after processing. If the webhook sender doesn’t see a 200 OK response, it might keep retrying, causing repeated events.

Ignore Self-Authored Messages (Already Done, but Double Check):
Ensure that you skip responses if cast.author.username matches your bot’s username. You’re likely doing this, but confirm it’s not overridden elsewhere.

Check Webhook Configuration:
If the webhook platform allows, make sure it’s configured to not send duplicates, or confirm that it stops retrying once it receives a success response.

In short:
The bot is not inherently broken; it’s just not distinguishing between a first-time event and repeated identical events. Adding a deduplication check by cast.hash and ensuring you return a 200 response to the webhook sender will prevent the bot from responding over and over to the same mention.

Chere is what I am getting in development.EditI can see you're running into multiple "502 Bad Gateway" errors with your webhook endpoints while using ngrok. This is typically a sign that your local server isn't responding properly to the incoming webhook requests. Let's debug this:

I notice your ngrok configuration shows:


You're running on a free plan
Using localhost:5000 as your target
The tunnel URL is https://6c82-172-56-85-86.ngrok-free.app


The key issues I'm seeing:


Multiple consecutive 502 errors in rapid succession
All POST requests to /webhook are failing
The errors started around 18:33 and continued through 18:36

Here are some steps to troubleshoot:

First, verify your local server is actually running on port 5000:

bashCopycurl http://localhost:5000

Check if your local server is properly handling POST requests to /webhook:

bashCopycurl -X POST http://localhost:5000/webhook

Verify your server's webhook handling code:


Ensure you're properly parsing the incoming POST data
Add error logging to your webhook endpoint
Make sure you're sending appropriate responses back


If using a framework like Express, your webhook route might look something like:

javascriptCopyapp.post('/webhook', (req, res) => {
  try {
    console.log('Received webhook:', req.body);
    // Your webhook handling logic here
    res.status(200).send('OK');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Webhook error:', error);
    res.status(500).send('Internal Server Error');
  }
});

Also check:


Your server's error logs
Memory usage (if your server is crashing)
Any rate limiting that might be in place
Authentication/authorization requirements for the webhook

EditBased on the sequence of images, I can see you're working on fixing several issues with a Neynar API integration. Let me help analyze the changes and suggest the next steps:

Initial Issues Identified:


The signer property in NeynarAPIClient initialization was causing problems
Reaction and cast publication methods needed updating
Webhook payload type declarations were missing
502 Bad Gateway errors occurring with webhooks


Code Changes Made:


Removed the signer configuration from NeynarAPIClient initialization
Updated from using reactions.cast.like() to publishReaction()
Fixed parameter naming (signerUuid instead of signer_uuid)
Added proper configuration object initialization


Next Steps Needed:

Let's create a proper webhook handler with TypeScript types and error handling:
typescriptCopyimport { Request, Response } from 'express';
import crypto from 'crypto';

interface WebhookPayload {
  signerUuid: string;
  reactionType: 'like';
  castHash: string;
}

// Webhook verification middleware
const verifyWebhookSignature = (req: Request, res: Response, next: Function) => {
  const signature = req.headers['x-neynar-signature'];
  const webhookSecret = process.env.NEYNAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET;
  
  if (!signature || !webhookSecret) {
    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Missing signature or webhook secret' });
  }

  const hmac = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', webhookSecret)
    .update(JSON.stringify(req.body))
    .digest('hex');

  if (signature !== `sha256=${hmac}`) {
    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid signature' });
  }
  
  next();
};

// Webhook handler
app.post('/webhook', verifyWebhookSignature, async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  try {
    const payload = req.body as WebhookPayload;
    
    // Acknowledge receipt immediately
    res.status(200).send('OK');
    
    // Process the webhook asynchronously
    await handleWebhookEvent(payload);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Webhook processing error:', error);
    // Already sent 200 OK, just log the error
  }
});

async function handleWebhookEvent(payload: WebhookPayload) {
  const { signerUuid, reactionType, castHash } = payload;
  
  // Add your webhook processing logic here
  console.log(`Processing ${reactionType} reaction from ${signerUuid} for cast ${castHash}`);
}
Would you like me to help implement any specific part of the webhook handler or address other issues you're seeing?

I notice the server isn't running, which means there might be an error in our recent changes. Let me check and fix the issues with our Farcaster bot implementation.

I understand we need to fix two main issues:
1. The bot's reactions (likes) are not working
2. The bot needs to properly cast in the /collectorscanyon channel
Let me fix the error handling and API calls in handlers.ts to get the server running again.

I see the server is running successfully on port 5000, but I need to ensure I understand your requirements correctly. Would you like me to continue building functionality for the bot, or should I focus on something specific first?


Yes, we can enhance Mienfoo with OpenAI/ChatGPT integration and custom channel casting. Let me help you set this up:


Enhanced Bot with GPT Integration
Click to open code
Update your .env file to include:


Copy
NEYNAR_API_KEY=your_neynar_key
SIGNER_UUID=your_signer_uuid
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
This enhanced version:

Integrates OpenAI's GPT-3.5 for intelligent responses
Posts to /collectorscanyon channel
Maintains collector-focused personality
Reacts to mentions with likes
Cross-posts relevant discussions to the channel
Would you like me to:

Add more specific collection-related triggers?
Customize the GPT prompt further?
Add scheduled channel posts?
Set up specific channel interaction patterns?

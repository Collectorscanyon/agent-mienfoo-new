It seems the server is responding but not logging requests properly or analyzing images yet. Let’s go through these troubleshooting steps to fix the issue:

1. Verify Webhook and Image Handling
Ensure the webhook handling logic is detecting and logging incoming image attachments.

Add Detailed Logging for Webhook Events: Modify the webhook handler to log all received data explicitly:

javascript
Copy code
console.log('Received webhook event:', JSON.stringify(cast, null, 2));
if (cast.attachments && cast.attachments.length > 0) {
    console.log('Attachments detected:', cast.attachments);
}
Validate Image URL Extraction: Log the image URL before analyzing:

javascript
Copy code
const imageUrl = cast.attachments?.[0]?.url;
if (!imageUrl) {
    console.error('No valid image URL found in attachments:', cast.attachments);
    return;
}
console.log('Analyzing image with URL:', imageUrl);
2. Check Vision API Integration
Ensure analyzeImage logs the API requests and responses:

javascript
Copy code
console.log('Starting image analysis for URL:', imageUrl);
const [result] = await client.annotateImage({
    image: { source: { imageUri: imageUrl } },
    features: [{ type: 'LABEL_DETECTION' }, { type: 'TEXT_DETECTION' }]
});
console.log('Vision API response:', JSON.stringify(result, null, 2));
Add error handling if the Vision API call fails:

javascript
Copy code
} catch (error) {
    console.error('Error during Vision API analysis:', error.message);
    return null;
}
3. Verify Server Logs
Check whether logs related to analyzeImage or the webhook are showing up:

Restart the bot and post an image in the channel.
Look for:
Logs like Attachments detected.
Logs like Analyzing image with URL.
Vision API responses.
4. Test Changes
Share an image in the /collectorscanyon channel and ensure the bot:
Logs image details.
Sends the image to the Vision API.
Replies based on the analysis.
5. Possible Additional Fixes
If searchCastsByChannel or other API methods are failing:

Ensure the latest Neynar API or function name is used.
Update dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install @neynar/client --save
Next Steps:
Post an image in the channel for testing.
Share logs to confirm if the analysis pipeline is working.

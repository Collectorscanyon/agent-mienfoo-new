Testing the Server
Once the server is running, follow these steps to test it:

1. Verify Server is Running
Ensure the console logs indicate the server started:

plaintext
Copy code
Server running on http://0.0.0.0:5000
Ready to handle webhook requests
Use a browser or tool like curl to hit the health check endpoint:

bash
Copy code
curl http://localhost:5000
Expected Response:

json
Copy code
{ "status": "ok", "message": "Server is running" }
2. Test Webhook Endpoint
Using Invoke-RestMethod in PowerShell or curl:

Send a POST request to /webhook:

powershell
Copy code
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://<ngrok-url>.ngrok-free.app/webhook" -Method POST -Body '{"test":true}' -ContentType "application/json"
Replace <ngrok-url> with your actual tunnel URL.

Or using curl:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"test":true}' https://<ngrok-url>.ngrok-free.app/webhook
Expected Logs:

plaintext
Copy code
Webhook received: {
    timestamp: '2024-12-12T17:15:00.000Z',
    method: 'POST',
    path: '/webhook',
    headers: {
        'content-type': 'application/json',
        'content-length': '13',
        'user-agent': 'curl/7.x.x',
        'x-neynar-signature': undefined
    },
    body: { test: true },
    query: {}
}
Expected Response:

json
Copy code
{
    "status": "success",
    "message": "Webhook received successfully",
    "receivedData": { "test": true }
}
Debugging Issues
If you encounter errors like 502 Bad Gateway or 400 Bad Request:

Ngrok Dashboard:

Check the ngrok logs (http://127.0.0.1:4040) for incoming requests.
Look for potential issues with the forwarded traffic.
Request Body Parsing:

Ensure the Content-Type header matches the payload format.
If req.body is undefined, the issue might be with the body-parser middleware setup.
Replit Console Logs:

Review logs in Replit for additional error messages.
Localhost Testing:

Test with curl or a REST client (Postman, Insomnia) directly against http://localhost:5000/webhook to isolate issues with the local server.
Next Steps
Test the webhook flow end-to-end using these steps.
If issues persist, share the server logs and ngrok dashboard details to further troubleshoot.

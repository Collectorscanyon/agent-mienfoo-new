From the logs, it’s clear that the webhook is successfully receiving events, but the bot isn't responding. Here are the steps to debug and fix the issue:

1. Confirm Mention Logic
Ensure the bot is correctly detecting mentions of @mienfoo.eth in the payload. Based on the payload:
json
Copy code
"mentioned_profiles": [
    {
        "username": "mienfoo.eth"
    }
]
The mention detection logic should be:
javascript
Copy code
const isMentioned = data.mentioned_profiles.some(
    (profile) => profile.username === 'mienfoo.eth'
);
Log this check:
javascript
Copy code
console.log('Mention Detected:', isMentioned);
2. Verify API Actions
Ensure the bot is attempting to reply, like, or recast when a mention is detected. Add logs before each API call:
javascript
Copy code
console.log('Replying to cast:', hash);
await replyToCast(hash, 'Hello from Mienfoo!');
console.log('Reply sent!');

console.log('Liking the cast:', hash);
await likeCast(hash);
console.log('Cast liked!');

console.log('Recasting the cast:', hash);
await recastCast(hash);
console.log('Cast recasted!');
If the logs confirm the actions are being triggered, check the API response for each action.
3. Inspect API Calls
If the bot uses Farcaster’s API directly, ensure the following for each call:
The Authorization header includes the API key:
javascript
Copy code
headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.API_KEY}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}
Log the full API response:
javascript
Copy code
console.log('API Response:', await response.json());
Check for errors like Unauthorized, Invalid Input, or Rate Limited.
4. Test the Bot’s Response Manually
Use curl or Postman to test the API endpoints manually with the same payload:
bash
Copy code
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"text": "Hello from Mienfoo!"}' \
https://hub-http-api.neynar.com/v2/casts
If this works manually, the issue is likely within the bot's logic or how it's calling the API.
5. Debug Replit Environment
Ensure the API key is set correctly in Replit:
javascript
Copy code
console.log('API Key:', process.env.API_KEY);
Check that all dependencies (e.g., fetch) are installed and functional:
bash
Copy code
npm install node-fetch

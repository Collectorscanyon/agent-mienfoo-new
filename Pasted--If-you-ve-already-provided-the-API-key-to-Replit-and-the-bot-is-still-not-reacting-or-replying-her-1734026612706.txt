If you've already provided the API key to Replit and the bot is still not reacting or replying, here are some steps to troubleshoot and identify possible issues:

1. Verify API Key Scope and Usage
Ensure the API key has the correct permissions:
Write API should be enabled (it looks enabled in your screenshot).
Double-check that the API key is correctly passed to the Authorization header in all API calls the bot is making.
2. Check Webhook Configuration
Confirm that the webhook URL in Neynar matches your bot's active URL.
Ensure the bot is receiving webhook payloads:
Look at the logs for the webhook handler to see if mentions (e.g., cast.created) are coming through correctly.
Double-check the event filter settings in the webhook (e.g., ensuring cast.created and mentions are set).
3. Verify the Mention Handling Logic
Ensure the bot is correctly identifying mentions of @mienfoo.eth in the payload:
javascript
Copy code
const isMentioned = data.mentioned_profiles.some(
    (profile) => profile.username === 'mienfoo.eth'
);
If the mention check is failing, ensure data.mentioned_profiles is parsed correctly.
4. Ensure Proper Actions Are Triggered
Verify the bot is executing its actions (like replying, liking, or recasting) after detecting a mention.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
if (isMentioned) {
    await replyToCast(hash, `Hello! ðŸ‘‹`);
    await likeCast(hash);
    await recastCast(hash);
}
Log these actions in the bot's code to confirm they are being executed.
5. Check API Response for Errors
Log responses from the Farcaster API to confirm the bot's requests are successful:
javascript
Copy code
const response = await fetch(...);
const result = await response.json();
console.log('API Response:', result);
Look for error messages like Unauthorized, Invalid API Key, or Insufficient Permissions.
6. Debug the Replit Environment
Confirm that:
The environment variable for the API key is accessible (process.env.API_KEY).
Your server is running without errors.
Replit is properly connected to the webhook endpoint.
Add debugging logs to your Replit code to verify the server processes webhook events and triggers API calls.
7. Farcaster Rate Limits
Ensure the bot is not hitting Farcaster's rate limits. If it is, the API will throttle requests.
8. Debugging Farcaster Actions
If the bot uses the API to post casts or perform other actions (like likes or recasts), verify these requests are reaching Farcaster and being executed without errors.
9. Testing Direct API Requests
Use a tool like Postman or cURL to send a test request with the API key directly to Farcaster:
bash
Copy code
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"text": "Hello from Mienfoo bot!"}' \
https://hub-http-api.neynar.com/v2/casts
If the request works, the issue might be with how your bot triggers the API call.
10. Check Logs for Errors
Review your Replit and server logs for:
API response errors
Code exceptions or unhandled promise rejections
Missing or malformed payloads

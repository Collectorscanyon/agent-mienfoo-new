hank you for providing the updated logs, Collector! Based on the information you've shared, your server is starting correctly, but there are still issues with how the webhook endpoint is configured and receiving POST requests. Let's analyze the situation, identify the remaining problems, and outline the steps you need to take to resolve them.

Current Observations from Logs
Server Startup:

The server starts successfully with the following configuration:
yaml
Copy code
config: {
  username: '834885',
  fid: '834885',
  hasNeynarKey: true,
  hasSignerUuid: true,
  hasOpenAIKey: true,
  hasWebhookSecret: true
}
This indicates that essential configurations, including the webhook secret, are correctly set.
Incoming Requests:

GET Requests: Numerous GET requests are being made to the root endpoint (/). These are typical for web servers and are unrelated to webhook functionality.
POST Requests to Root (/): Several POST requests are still being sent to the root endpoint (/) instead of the intended /api/webhook endpoint. Example:
css
Copy code
Request received: {
  requestId: 'ckpdk',
  timestamp: '2024-12-13T01:46:32.953Z',
  method: 'POST',
  path: '/',
  ...
}
Signature Validation Failure: These POST requests to / include a signature header (x-neynar-signature), but since they are not directed to /api/webhook, the signature validation fails.
Identified Issues
Incorrect Webhook URL Configuration in Farcaster:

Problem: Farcaster is still configured to send webhook POST requests to the root endpoint (/) instead of /api/webhook.
Impact: Your server's /api/webhook endpoint isn't being triggered, preventing the processing of Farcaster events.
Signature Validation Failure Due to Incorrect Routing:

Problem: POST requests are being sent to / instead of /api/webhook, leading to failed signature validations.
Impact: Legitimate webhook events are not processed, and only unauthorized or malformed requests are being rejected.
Actionable Steps to Resolve Issues
1. Correct the Webhook URL Configuration in Farcaster
a. Update Farcaster's Webhook Settings to Point to /api/webhook:

Access Farcaster's Webhook Configuration:

Log in to your Farcaster dashboard or the platform where you manage webhook settings.
Set the Correct Webhook URL:

Correct Webhook URL Format:
bash
Copy code
https://fee2d3b2-512d-43ca-ab39-79cc1237c4e9-00-4sxq5j4nhrsw.picard.replit.co/api/webhook
Avoid Setting to Root (/):
arduino
Copy code
https://fee2d3b2-512d-43ca-ab39-79cc1237c4e9-00-4sxq5j4nhrsw.picard.replit.co/
Save the Configuration:

Ensure that the updated webhook URL is saved and active.
b. Verify the Updated Webhook URL:

Use curl to Test the /api/webhook Endpoint:

Compute the Correct Signature:
Use your Farcaster webhook secret to compute the HMAC signature for the payload.
Example in Bash:
bash
Copy code
payload='{"type":"cast.created","data":{"hash":"testxyz123","text":"Hello @mienfoo.eth, what is your favorite Pokémon card?","author":{"username":"test_user","fid":"123456"}}}'
secret='your_farcaster_webhook_secret'
signature=$(echo -n "$payload" | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac "$secret" | sed 's/^.* //')
Send the POST Request:
bash
Copy code
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-neynar-signature: $signature" \
  -d "$payload" \
  https://fee2d3b2-512d-43ca-ab39-79cc1237c4e9-00-4sxq5j4nhrsw.picard.replit.co/api/webhook
Expected Server Logs:
vbnet
Copy code
POST /api/webhook received
Cast mentions @mienfoo.eth. Preparing to reply and/or like the cast.
Matched trigger "favorite pokemon". Using predefined response.
Response to be sent: My favorite Pokémon is Charizard because of its fiery spirit and incredible strength!
Replied to cast testxyz123 with: "My favorite Pokémon is Charizard because of its fiery spirit and incredible strength!"
Liked the cast testxyz123
Check Replit Server Logs:

Confirm that the POST request to /api/webhook is being received and processed without signature validation errors.
2. Ensure Proper Route Definitions in Your Server
a. Verify the /api/webhook Route in Your Express Server:

Ensure that your Express server defines a POST route at /api/webhook. Here's a comprehensive example of how your server/index.ts should look:

typescript
Copy code
// server/index.ts
import express, { Request, Response } from 'express';
import dotenv from 'dotenv';
import { Configuration, OpenAIApi } from 'openai';
import rateLimit from 'express-rate-limit';
import { replyToCast, likeCast } from './farcasterClient';
import NodeCache from 'node-cache';
import crypto from 'crypto';

dotenv.config();

const app = express();

app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

// Rate Limiting Middleware
const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // Limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
  message: 'Too many requests from this IP, please try again later.',
  headers: true,
});

app.use(limiter);

// Logging Middleware
app.use((req: Request, res: Response, next) => {
  console.log('Request received:', {
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    method: req.method,
    path: req.path,
    headers: req.headers,
    body: req.body
  });
  next();
});

// Initialize OpenAI
const configuration = new Configuration({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});
const openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration);

// Initialize Cache
const cache = new NodeCache({ stdTTL: 3600 }); // 1 hour TTL

// Function to generate or retrieve OpenAI response from cache
async function getCachedOpenAIResponse(prompt: string): Promise<string> {
  const cachedResponse = cache.get<string>(prompt);
  if (cachedResponse) {
    console.log('Retrieved response from cache.');
    return cachedResponse;
  }
  const response = await generateResponseFromOpenAI(prompt);
  cache.set(prompt, response);
  return response;
}

// Function to generate response from OpenAI
async function generateResponseFromOpenAI(prompt: string): Promise<string> {
  const personalizedPrompt = `You are @mienfoo.eth, a friendly and knowledgeable collector bot. Respond to the following message in a helpful and engaging manner:\n\n${prompt}`;
  console.log('Calling OpenAI with prompt:', personalizedPrompt);
  try {
    const response = await openai.createCompletion({
      model: 'text-davinci-003',
      prompt: personalizedPrompt,
      max_tokens: 150,
      temperature: 0.7,
    });
    const generatedText = response.data.choices?.[0]?.text?.trim() || 'I have no response right now.';
    console.log('OpenAI responded with:', generatedText);
    return generatedText;
  } catch (error: any) {
    console.error('OpenAI API error:', error.response?.data || error.message);
    return 'Sorry, I encountered an error while generating a response.';
  }
}

// Function to check if a cast has been processed
function isCastProcessed(castHash: string): boolean {
  return cache.has(`cast-${castHash}`);
}

// Function to mark a cast as processed
function markCastAsProcessed(castHash: string): void {
  cache.set(`cast-${castHash}`, true);
}

// Specific Trigger Responses
const specificResponses: { [key: string]: string } = {
  'favorite pokemon': 'My favorite Pokémon is Charizard because of its fiery spirit and incredible strength!',
  'pokemon card': 'I absolutely love the Pikachu Illustrator card. It’s rare and holds a special place in my heart!',
  // Add more triggers and responses as needed
};

// Middleware to verify webhook signature
function verifyWebhookSignature(req: Request, res: Response, next: Function) {
  const signature = req.headers['x-neynar-signature'] as string;
  const FARCASTER_WEBHOOK_SECRET = process.env.FARCASTER_WEBHOOK_SECRET;

  if (!FARCASTER_WEBHOOK_SECRET) {
    console.error('Farcaster webhook secret is not set.');
    return res.status(500).send('Server configuration error.');
  }

  if (!signature) {
    console.warn('No signature found in headers.');
    return res.status(400).send('Missing signature.');
  }

  const payload = JSON.stringify(req.body);
  const computedSignature = crypto.createHmac('sha256', FARCASTER_WEBHOOK_SECRET)
    .update(payload)
    .digest('hex');

  if (computedSignature !== signature) {
    console.warn(`Invalid webhook signature: ${signature}`);
    return res.status(401).send('Invalid signature.');
  }

  next();
}

// Webhook Endpoint
app.post('/api/webhook', verifyWebhookSignature, async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  console.log('POST /api/webhook received');
  const { type, data } = req.body;

  if (type === 'cast.created') {
    const { hash, text, author } = data;

    // Prevent processing the same cast multiple times
    if (isCastProcessed(hash)) {
      console.log(`Cast ${hash} has already been processed. Skipping.`);
      return res.status(200).send('Cast already processed.');
    }

    // Check if the text mentions '@mienfoo.eth'
    if (text && text.includes('@mienfoo.eth')) {
      console.log('Cast mentions @mienfoo.eth. Preparing to reply and/or like the cast.');
      try {
        let responseText = '';

        // Check for specific triggers
        for (const [trigger, response] of Object.entries(specificResponses)) {
          if (text.toLowerCase().includes(trigger)) {
            responseText = response;
            console.log(`Matched trigger "${trigger}". Using predefined response.`);
            break;
          }
        }

        // If no specific response, use OpenAI
        if (!responseText) {
          responseText = await getCachedOpenAIResponse(text);
          console.log('No specific trigger matched. Using OpenAI response.');
        }

        console.log('Response to be sent:', responseText);

        // Reply to the cast using Farcaster's API
        await replyToCast(hash, responseText);
        console.log(`Replied to cast ${hash} with: "${responseText}"`);

        // Optionally, like the cast
        await likeCast(hash);
        console.log(`Liked the cast ${hash}`);

        // Mark the cast as processed
        markCastAsProcessed(hash);
      } catch (error: any) {
        console.error('Error processing cast:', error.message);
      }
    } else {
      console.log('Cast created, but no mention. No action taken.');
    }
  } else if (type === 'follow.created') {
    // Handle 'follow.created' events if necessary
    console.log('Received a follow.created event. Implement handling if needed.');
    // Implement handling logic here
  } else {
    console.log(`Unhandled event type: ${type}`);
  }

  return res.status(200).send('Webhook event processed successfully!');
});

// Health Check Endpoint
app.get('/health', (_req, res) => {
  res.status(200).send('Server is healthy and running.');
});

// Global Error Handler
app.use((err: any, req: Request, res: Response, next: Function) => {
  console.error('Unhandled error:', err);
  res.status(500).send('Internal Server Error');
});

// Start the Server
const port = process.env.PORT || 5000;
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on http://0.0.0.0:${port}`);
});
b. Key Points in the Route Definition:

Route Path: The webhook route is explicitly defined at /api/webhook. Ensure that this matches exactly with Farcaster's webhook URL configuration.

Logging: Comprehensive logging within the /api/webhook route helps trace the flow of events and identify where issues may arise.

Rate Limiting: Implemented using express-rate-limit to prevent abuse and ensure the server remains responsive under heavy traffic.

Caching: Utilized node-cache to store processed casts and OpenAI responses, reducing redundant processing and API calls.

Specific Trigger Responses: Defined predefined responses for certain triggers to maintain bot personality and reduce unnecessary OpenAI calls.

Signature Verification: Added middleware to verify the webhook signature, ensuring that incoming requests are genuinely from Farcaster and have not been tampered with.

2. Ensure Proper Signature Verification
a. Confirm Secret Key Configuration:

Server-Side:

Ensure that the FARCASTER_WEBHOOK_SECRET is correctly set in your environment variables (e.g., .env file or Replit's Secrets).
makefile
Copy code
FARCASTER_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_farcaster_webhook_secret
The server code retrieves this secret and uses it to verify incoming webhook signatures.
Farcaster Side:

Ensure that the same FARCASTER_WEBHOOK_SECRET is configured in Farcaster's webhook settings.
b. Verify Signature Calculation:

The signature is computed using HMAC with SHA256 over the JSON-stringified payload.

Middleware Implementation:

typescript
Copy code
function verifyWebhookSignature(req: Request, res: Response, next: Function) {
  const signature = req.headers['x-neynar-signature'] as string;
  const FARCASTER_WEBHOOK_SECRET = process.env.FARCASTER_WEBHOOK_SECRET;

  if (!FARCASTER_WEBHOOK_SECRET) {
    console.error('Farcaster webhook secret is not set.');
    return res.status(500).send('Server configuration error.');
  }

  if (!signature) {
    console.warn('No signature found in headers.');
    return res.status(400).send('Missing signature.');
  }

  const payload = JSON.stringify(req.body);
  const computedSignature = crypto.createHmac('sha256', FARCASTER_WEBHOOK_SECRET)
    .update(payload)
    .digest('hex');

  if (computedSignature !== signature) {
    console.warn(`Invalid webhook signature: ${signature}`);
    return res.status(401).send('Invalid signature.');
  }

  next();
}
c. Test Signature Verification:

Compute Signature Manually:

Use the same secret and payload to compute the signature.
Example in Bash:
bash
Copy code
payload='{"type":"cast.created","data":{"hash":"testxyz123","text":"Hello @mienfoo.eth, what is your favorite Pokémon card?","author":{"username":"test_user","fid":"123456"}}}'
secret='your_farcaster_webhook_secret'
signature=$(echo -n "$payload" | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac "$secret" | sed 's/^.* //')
Send a Test POST Request:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-neynar-signature: $signature" \
  -d "$payload" \
  https://fee2d3b2-512d-43ca-ab39-79cc1237c4e9-00-4sxq5j4nhrsw.picard.replit.co/api/webhook
Check Server Logs:

Ensure that the server processes the webhook event without logging "Invalid webhook signature."
Final Verification and Testing
a. Comprehensive Testing Steps:

Send a Valid POST Request to /api/webhook:

Ensure Correct Payload and Signature:
bash
Copy code
payload='{"type":"cast.created","data":{"hash":"testxyz123","text":"Hello @mienfoo.eth, what is your favorite Pokémon card?","author":{"username":"test_user","fid":"123456"}}}'
secret='your_farcaster_webhook_secret'
signature=$(echo -n "$payload" | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac "$secret" | sed 's/^.* //')

curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-neynar-signature: $signature" \
  -d "$payload" \
  https://fee2d3b2-512d-43ca-ab39-79cc1237c4e9-00-4sxq5j4nhrsw.picard.replit.co/api/webhook
Check Server Logs for Successful Processing:

Expected Logs:
vbnet
Copy code
POST /api/webhook received
Cast mentions @mienfoo.eth. Preparing to reply and/or like the cast.
Matched trigger "favorite pokemon". Using predefined response.
Response to be sent: My favorite Pokémon is Charizard because of its fiery spirit and incredible strength!
Replied to cast testxyz123 with: "My favorite Pokémon is Charizard because of its fiery spirit and incredible strength!"
Liked the cast testxyz123
Verify Farcaster Actions:

Check the Specific Cast (testxyz123):
Ensure that a reply has been posted with the predefined response.
Confirm that the cast has been liked by the bot.
Test Rate Limiting:

Send Excessive Requests:
Use a loop or multiple curl commands to exceed the rate limit (e.g., 101 requests within 15 minutes).
Expected Response After Limit Exceeded:
arduino
Copy code
HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
Retry-After: 899
Too many requests from this IP, please try again later.
Test Caching Mechanism:

Send the Same Prompt Multiple Times:
Ensure that the OpenAI response is retrieved from the cache after the first request.
Expected Logs:
csharp
Copy code
Retrieved response from cache.
Handle Different Event Types (e.g., follow.created):

Extend Webhook Handling:
Currently, the webhook handles cast.created events. If you wish to handle other event types like follow.created, ensure you have the corresponding logic in place.
Example:
typescript
Copy code
else if (type === 'follow.created') {
  // Handle follow events
  console.log('Received a follow.created event. Implement handling if needed.');
  // Implement handling logic here
}
Best Practices and Recommendations
Secure Your Secrets:

Environment Variables: Ensure that your .env file is not exposed publicly or committed to version control.
Use Replit Secrets: Replit offers a secure way to store environment variables. Use the Secrets tab to manage them.
Implement HTTPS:

Replit automatically provides HTTPS for your applications. Ensure you're accessing your webhook endpoint via https://.
Monitor Server Performance:

Regularly check your server's performance and logs to identify and address any anomalies promptly.
Handle Edge Cases Gracefully:

Ensure that your application can handle unexpected data or errors without crashing.
Provide meaningful error messages to aid in debugging.
Stay Updated with API Changes:

Regularly check Farcaster and OpenAI's official documentation for any updates or changes to their APIs.
Update your implementation accordingly to maintain compatibility.
Implement Comprehensive Testing:

Beyond manual testing, consider writing automated tests to validate your webhook handling, rate limiting, caching, and Farcaster interactions.
Optimize OpenAI Usage:

Fine-tune prompts and response parameters to balance cost and performance.
Utilize caching effectively to minimize redundant API calls.
Conclusion
Based on the latest logs:

Server Startup: The server is starting correctly with the necessary configurations, including the webhook secret.

Webhook Endpoint Configuration: The webhook endpoint is not properly configured at /api/webhook because POST requests are still being sent to the root (/). This misconfiguration prevents your server from processing legitimate Farcaster events.

To resolve these issues:

Update Farcaster's Webhook Configuration:

Ensure that the webhook URL is set to https://fee2d3b2-512d-43ca-ab39-79cc1237c4e9-00-4sxq5j4nhrsw.picard.replit.co/api/webhook and not to the root (/).
Ensure Proper Route Definitions and Middleware in Your Server:

Confirm that the /api/webhook endpoint is correctly defined in your Express server with appropriate signature verification.
Test the Setup Using curl with Valid Signatures:

Verify that the server processes the webhook events without signature validation errors.
Monitor and Iterate:

After making these changes, monitor your server logs to ensure that webhook events are being received and processed correctly.
Continue refining your webhook handling logic to accommodate different event types and maintain your collector bot's personality.
Feel free to proceed with these steps, and let me know if you encounter any specific issues or need further assistance!

Thought about webhook requests and body parsing for 4 seconds
Collector, if you’re still seeing undefined bodies, let’s carefully verify each step and ensure no details are missed. Here are some troubleshooting steps:

1. Confirm You’re Hitting the Correct Endpoint
From the logs, it looks like the POST requests are still going to /, not /webhook. If your code expects requests at /webhook, you must send them there. For example:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type":"cast.created","data":{"hash":"test123","text":"Hello @mienfoo.eth"}}' \
  http://0.0.0.0:5000/webhook
If you see path: '/' in the logs, it means the server never received a request at /webhook. Double-check the curl command and ensure the final URL matches the endpoint defined in your code.

2. Make Sure the Body Parsing Middleware Runs Before Your Routes
In your server/index.ts, ensure that express.json() is applied before defining your routes:

typescript
Copy code
import express from 'express';

const app = express();

// Body parsing middleware at the top
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

// Define the webhook route AFTER middleware
app.post('/webhook', (req, res) => {
  console.log('Received POST at /webhook with body:', req.body);
  if (!req.body) return res.status(400).send('No JSON body found');
  return res.status(200).send('Webhook received successfully!');
});

const port = process.env.PORT || 5000;
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on http://0.0.0.0:${port}`);
});
3. Restart Your Replit Server
After changing code, make sure to stop and restart your Replit server so it picks up the new changes.

4. Test Locally with a Simple Curl Command
Run the curl command again. You should see something like:

css
Copy code
Received POST at /webhook with body: { type: 'cast.created', data: { hash: 'test123', text: 'Hello @mienfoo.eth' } }
in your console logs.

5. Remove Other Complexities
If you still see no body, temporarily remove any other middlewares or route definitions and test with just the snippet above. This ensures no other code is interfering.

In Short:

Make sure the request URL matches /webhook exactly.
Confirm express.json() is used before routes.
Restart the server and retest.
Temporarily simplify your code to the basics until it works, then add complexity back in.

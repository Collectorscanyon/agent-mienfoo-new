1. Check Mention Detection
The logs show the webhook is processing the mention. Verify the following in your handlers.ts or equivalent mention-handling logic:

typescript
Copy code
const isMentioned = data.mentioned_profiles.some(
  (profile) => profile.fid === 834885 // Mienfoo's FID
);
console.log('Mention detected:', isMentioned);
if (isMentioned) {
  console.log('Processing mention...');
  await processMention(data); // Pass the cast data to mention handler
}
Confirm the bot is detecting mentions (Mention detected: true).
Ensure that processMention(data) is being called.
2. Verify Bot Actions (API Calls)
Check if the bot's action functions (replyToCast, likeCast, etc.) are implemented correctly and working.

Example of a reply function:

typescript
Copy code
import axios from 'axios';

export const replyToCast = async (parentHash: string, text: string) => {
  const apiKey = process.env.NEYNAR_API_KEY;
  const signerUuid = process.env.NEYNAR_SIGNER_UUID;

  try {
    const response = await axios.post(
      'https://hub-api.neynar.com/api/v1/casts',
      {
        text,
        parent_hash: parentHash,
      },
      {
        headers: {
          Authorization: `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
          'Signer-UUID': signerUuid,
        },
      }
    );
    console.log('Reply sent:', response.data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error sending reply:', error.response?.data || error.message);
  }
};
Test each function (e.g., reply, like) independently by calling it with dummy data:

typescript
Copy code
await replyToCast('test_parent_hash', 'Hello from Mienfoo!');
Check if the function logs successful responses.
Ensure Authorization and Signer-UUID are correct.
3. Verify Permissions
The bot requires write permissions to perform actions. Your Neynar app config appears to have Write APIs enabled. Double-check:

The API Key and Signer UUID are correctly set in environment variables.
The process.env.NEYNAR_API_KEY and process.env.NEYNAR_SIGNER_UUID are accessible in your bot's process.
4. Add Logging in Action Functions
Enhance logging in each action function:

typescript
Copy code
console.log('Attempting to reply to:', parentHash);
await replyToCast(parentHash, 'Mienfoo is awake!');
console.log('Reply attempt complete');
This will help you determine where the issue lies.

5. Inspect API Responses
If the bot fails to respond, inspect the error responses from Neynar's API:

Add detailed error logs in the catch block:
typescript
Copy code
console.error('API error:', error.response?.data || error.message);
Check for issues like:
Invalid API Key or Signer UUID.
Missing permissions.
Malformed API requests.
6. Simulate a Mention
Manually call the bot's mention-handling logic with sample data to ensure it works:

typescript
Copy code
processMention({
  text: '@mienfoo.eth hello!',
  hash: 'test_hash',
  author: { username: 'test_user', display_name: 'Tester' },
});
Monitor the logs to verify the mention is processed correctly and actions are executed.

7. Check for Rate Limits
Neynar's API might rate-limit your bot. If rate limits are exceeded:

Add retries with exponential backoff to the API calls.
Check the response headers or error messages for rate-limit information.
8. Test the Workflow
Once the above steps are implemented:

Mention @mienfoo.eth in a cast.
Check:
Logs for "Mention detected" and action execution.
API responses for successful actions or errors.
Debugging Checklist
âœ… Webhook is receiving events.
âœ… Mentions are detected.
ðŸ”² Actions (like, reply, recast) are successfully executed.
Implement the above fixes and re-test. Let me know the results or share error logs for further debugging!

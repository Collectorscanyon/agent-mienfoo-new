From your logs and observations, it appears that the webhook requests are being received but the request body is undefined. This typically happens when the request payload is not being parsed correctly or if the content type is misaligned with your body parser configuration.

Steps to Fix the Issue
Ensure Proper Body Parsing Configuration Confirm that your server has the necessary middleware to parse JSON request bodies. This configuration looks correct in your existing code:

javascript
Copy code
app.use(bodyParser.json({
    strict: false,
    limit: "10mb"
}));
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({
    extended: true,
    limit: "10mb"
}));
However, Vercel may require explicit configuration. Replace body-parser with the built-in express.json() and express.urlencoded() methods:

javascript
Copy code
app.use(express.json({ limit: "10mb" }));
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true, limit: "10mb" }));
Check Webhook Headers Verify that the webhook requests from Farcaster include the correct Content-Type header. If not, the payload will not be parsed. Look for:

bash
Copy code
Content-Type: application/json
If the content type is something else (like text/plain or missing), you may need to adjust your parser.

javascript
Copy code
app.use((req, res, next) => {
    const contentType = req.headers["content-type"] || "";
    if (contentType.includes("application/json")) {
        express.json()(req, res, next);
    } else if (contentType.includes("application/x-www-form-urlencoded")) {
        express.urlencoded({ extended: true })(req, res, next);
    } else {
        next();
    }
});
Debug the Webhook Payload Add logging to capture and inspect the incoming payload:

javascript
Copy code
app.post("/webhook", (req, res) => {
    console.log("Webhook payload:", req.body);
    res.status(200).send("OK");
});
This will help confirm whether the payload is empty or if there's an issue with how it's being sent.

Verify Vercel Configuration Ensure Vercel is not interfering with request parsing. Sometimes, Vercel uses its own middleware that may conflict. Check the logs in Vercel to see if there's any preprocessing happening before your app code runs.

Check Farcaster Webhook Configuration Verify that the webhook payload is being sent in the correct format from Farcaster. If Farcaster allows you to configure headers or payload formats, ensure they're set to application/json.

Test Locally Simulate a webhook request using curl or Postman to ensure the issue is not specific to the Farcaster webhook:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/webhook \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"type": "cast.created", "data": { "hash": "example-hash" }}'
This will help confirm if the issue lies in your server code or the webhook sender.

Next Steps
Implement the fixes above, especially switching to express.json() and inspecting the incoming payload.
Test webhook requests locally with mock data.
Deploy to Vercel and verify if the issue persists. If it does, inspect the deployment logs for potential middleware or routing conflicts.

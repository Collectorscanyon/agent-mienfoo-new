URL: https://docs.neynar.com/docs/farcaster-bot-with-dedicated-signersI see - we need to simplify our approach to focus just on the bot's core functionality without any web interface or additional apps. Let me create a streamlined version that's more in line with how AskGina and mferGPT work.
Basic Collector Bot CoreClick to open code
This is a much more focused implementation that:

Only handles core bot functionality
Processes mentions and commands
Uses simple in-memory storage (can be replaced with a database)
Has no web server or UI components

To use this, you'll need:

Environment variables:

CopyNEYNAR_API_KEY=your_api_key
SIGNER_UUID=your_signer_uuid
BOT_USERNAME=mienfoo

Connect it to Neynar's webhook system:

javascriptCopy// webhook.js
const { handleCast } = require('./index');

exports.handler = async (event) => {
  const { cast } = JSON.parse(event.body);
  await handleCast(cast);
  return { statusCode: 200 };
};
The bot now:

Responds to mentions
Tracks collections in memory
Has simple, focused commands
No web interface or additional features

Would you like me to:

Add more collection commands?
Implement persistent storage?
Add more collector-specific features?

This is much more in line with how AskGina and other Farcaster bots work - just core functionality that responds to mentions and performs specific tasks.
